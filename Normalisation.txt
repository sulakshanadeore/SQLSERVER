

	Normalisation is the process of organizing the data in the database to avoid redundancy, insertion anomaly, deletion anomaly,updation anomaly.

companyDB
---------
emp			allow null-false
empid ename address    deptno
 1	A	Delhi   10
 1  	A 	Delhi	20
 3 	B	Pune 	30
 4 	C	Hyd	40
 4 	C 	Hyd	50

update anomaly--- inconsistent
insert anomaly---  will not be able to insert
delete anomaly--- 20--- B ----b employee deleted

First NF--- a column cannot have multiple value stored.

 4 	C	Hyd	40243245
 5 	E 	Hyd	50234234

This is not in 1st NF, 
"Each attribute of a table must have atomic (single value)"

 5 	E 	Hyd	50234234

2nd NF---

It is said in 2nd NF
1) it is 1nf
2) no non-prime attribute is dependent on the proper subset
of any candidate key of table.

teacher_id 	subject		age
111		M1		34
111		M2		34
222		B		35
333		C		45
444		D		36

age--- Non prime(non important)
teacher_id,subject--- candidate keys

teacherdetails
teacher_id	teacher_age
111		34
222		35
333		45
444		36

3 NF
-----
To be in 3rd NF

1) it should be in 2nd NF
2)transitive functional dependency of non-prime attribute on any
 super key should be removed.

Non-Prime
-------
A attribute that is not a part of any candidate key is known 
as non-prime attribute.

Prime
-----
An attribute that is a part of the candidate key is a prime attribute.

SuperKey--- is a key with which u shud be able to identify the whole
row uniquely.
  SuperKeys---  empid, empid+ename, empid+ename+pin,  empid+ename+pin+state......

Candidate Key----  empid

Non-prime---all attributes except empid are non-prime
